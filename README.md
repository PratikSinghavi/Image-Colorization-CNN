# Image-Colorization-CNN

The notebook contains a CNN architecture involving 2 convolution layers, 2 max pool layers and 2 dense layers with a softmax output layer.
The CNN aims to colorize a 32x32 grayscale image into a n-colored image for birds from CIFAR-10 image dataset.

## Results

Our architecture is fairly simple yet effective as it yields 91% accuracy for a 4-color output image on the above mentioned task. Please refer to the notebook for more details.
